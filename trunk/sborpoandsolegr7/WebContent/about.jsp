The site designed specially in jsp technology  , where the operations on the Database
mostly were done by Servlets.<br/>
The parameters checking was on the both sides , in Java-script on the client side
and with simple parameter and authorization checks on the Server side.
The site uses the Realm for user authentication an confirmation.
<br/>
<br/>
The advanced features that we have implemented are:
<br/>
1)Web Service. <br/>
2) XSLT reports.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Presenting free time slots for instruments reservations was done by Timeline
where each user can see the free places in friendly manner.
